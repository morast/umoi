Dancers move very slow. Standing in one line. They kinda seem to do the same.
First they stand and slowly after time the enter the floor. Their hand reaches out again and again made to reach for something or grab. But everytime the try to reach for something they return to the floor.When they reach
it is always with the left hand. Longing for something.
